# EmployeeWebApi

In this project, we will be creating an Angular 15 web application using Angular's latest version.   
This application will primarily perform Angular CRUD operations.   
As our API, we will use ASP.NET Core or .NET 7 to create a Web API from scratch.   
In our ASP.NET 7 Web API, we will use entity framework core and SQL Server to perform our CRUD operations.   
We will create a new database from scratch using EF Core migrations.   
In our Angular 15 application, we will create multiple components and we will set up routing for these components as well.  
We will use Bootstrap 5 in our Angular website to make the front end web components.
