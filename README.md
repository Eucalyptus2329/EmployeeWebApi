# EmployeeWebApi

In this project, we will be creating an Angular 15 web application using Angular's latest version. br
This application will primarily perform Angular CRUD operations. /br
As our API, we will use ASP.NET Core or .NET 7 to create a Web API from scratch.  /br
In our ASP.NET 7 Web API, we will use entity framework core and SQL Server to perform our CRUD operations.  /br
We will create a new database from scratch using EF Core migrations. /br
In our Angular 15 application, we will create multiple components and we will set up routing for these components as well. /br
We will use Bootstrap 5 in our Angular website to make the front end web components. /br
